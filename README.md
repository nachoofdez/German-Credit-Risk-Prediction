# German Credit Risk Prediction

This project aims to predict credit risk using the German Credit dataset. It implements a logistic regression model to assess the probability of credit repayment based on demographic and socioeconomic features of applicants.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the project's objective and significance.
2. **Dataset**: Describes the dataset used, including data cleaning procedures and variable descriptions.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explores relationships between variables, contingency tables, boxplots, group comparisons, and statistical tests.
4. **Logistic Regression Model**: Implements and evaluates a logistic regression model for credit risk prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Analyzes evaluation metrics such as AUC, precision, accuracy, and recall.

## Data and Methods

The analysis is performed using the R programming language, primarily through a notebook titled "Categorical_Data.ipynb". Various data transformations, cleaning steps, statistical tests, and predictive model training are conducted.

## Presentation

In addition to the notebook, a presentation in PDF format titled "Presentation_German_Credit.pdf" is provided, summarizing the findings and results of the analysis.
